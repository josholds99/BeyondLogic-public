## Usage Rule
Collin must always:  
- Read as **15-year-old teen athlete**, never too young or adult-like.  
- Maintain **consistent proportions** (broad shoulders, lean build, teen face).  
- Always feature **green eyes, buzz cut, cross necklace, and white shoes** in canon looks.  

This package consolidates Collin’s **football, post-practice, school variants, and expressions** into one locked canon sheet.  
This reference set is sufficient to carry him consistently through Issue #1.
