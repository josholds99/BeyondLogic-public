# Football Field — Canon Reference Kit (South-to-North Baseline)

## Core Identity Anchor (always include):
- High school football field with green turf, yard markers, and a track around it.
- Orientation locked to reference photo (uploaded 2025-09-22).
- Camera positioned behind the **south end zone**, looking **north** across the field.
- **North end zone goalpost is always visible in the distance.**
- **Bleachers on the left side mid-frame.**
- **No scoreboard visible.**
- Light poles and surrounding open land visible.
- Lighting: typically golden hour for practice sequences (warm light, long shadows).

## Layout Rules for Generator
Always describe as:  
“Perspective from the south end zone looking north. North goalpost visible in the distance. Bleachers on the left side mid-frame. No scoreboard.”  
This phrasing must be reused in all prompts to avoid drift.

## Variant 1 — Empty Field
- Wide establishing shot, camera at south end zone looking north.
- North end goalpost visible.
- Turf, yard markers, and track dominate frame.
- Bleachers left side, no scoreboard.

## Variant 2 — Practice Setup
- Same perspective.
- Players spread across mid-field in warmup/practice.
- Coaches, cones, tackling sleds along sideline.
- Bleachers left side, no scoreboard.
