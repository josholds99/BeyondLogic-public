# Football Field — Canon Reference Kit (South-to-North Baseline)

**Core Identity Anchor (always include):**
- High school football field with **green turf**, yard markers, and a track around it.  
- **Orientation locked to reference photo (uploaded 2025-09-22):**  
  - Camera positioned **behind the south end zone, looking north across the field**.  
  - **Scoreboard and bleachers are at the south end** (behind the camera).  
  - **North end zone goalpost is always visible in the distance**.  
  - Light poles and surrounding open land visible.  
- Lighting: typically **golden hour** for practice sequences (warm light, long shadows).

## Layout Rules for Generator
- Always describe as:  
  > “Perspective from the **south end zone looking north**. Scoreboard and bleachers behind the camera. Opposite north end zone goalpost visible.”  
- This phrasing must be reused in all prompts to avoid drift.

## Variant 1 — Empty Field
- Wide establishing shot, camera at south end zone looking north.  
- North end goalpost visible.  
- Turf, yard markers, and track dominate frame.  

## Variant 2 — Practice Setup
- Same perspective.  
- Players blurred in mid-field.  
- Coaches, cones, tackling sleds along south end zone sideline.  

## Variant 3 — North End Zone Angle
- Camera flipped: from north end zone looking back south.  
- Foreground: north goalpost.  
- Background: scoreboard and bleachers at far south end.

# ✅ Usage
When writing prompts, shorthand like:  
> “Environment: Football field (canon — camera behind south end zone looking north, scoreboard/bleachers behind camera, opposite north goalpost visible).”

This keeps the field **consistent and reproducible** for all panels.
