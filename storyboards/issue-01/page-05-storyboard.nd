## Usage Rule
- All anchors from **Garage Master A** must remain consistent.  
- Josh and Collin must always adhere to **character canons** (build, outfits, proportions).  
- Negative space must always be preserved where dialogue balloons will be added.  
- **Panel 5: Balloon locked in. Panel 6: No balloon locked in.**  
- No drifting environment details or changes in proportions.
