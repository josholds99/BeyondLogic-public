Flooring: tiled, reflecting turquoise glow.  
**Collin Young** (grey T-shirt, blue jeans, white sneakers, cross necklace, buzz cut, lean athletic build) walking centered with **head down, body language heavy**.  
**Camera Placement:** Straight-on, eye-level, facing down the length of the hallway toward Collin’s approach.
