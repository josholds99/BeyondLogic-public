## ✅ Professional Assessment
- Range: 3–6 panels throughout, with a single splash (Page 24).
- Average: ~5 panels per page (industry sweet spot for YA/superhero).
- Variation: 
  - Low (3–4) used for cinematic/mythic or “rest beats”.
  - High (6) used for tense escalation and dialogue-heavy moments.
  - Splash (1) reserved for big climax.
- Result: Reads professional and deliberate, not mechanical.
