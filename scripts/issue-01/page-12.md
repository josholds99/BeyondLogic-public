# Beyond Logic – Issue 1  
## Page 12 (4 Panels)

### Proposed Panel Layout  
- **Top Row (Wide):**  
  - **Panel 1 (Wide, Bedroom Door Entry)** → Collin entering messy room, muttered line.  
- **Middle Row (2 Panels):**  
  - **Panel 2 (Mid, Nightstand)** → phone drop, Snickers hops up.  
  - **Panel 3 (Mid, Bed Collapse)** → Collin face-planting onto bed, exhausted.  
- **Bottom Row (Close):**  
  - **Panel 4 (Close, Collin & Snickers)** → quiet close-up of boy and dog together, ending the issue.

### Script (4 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, Bedroom Door Entry)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of Collin pushing open his messy bedroom door, clothes and books scattered. His duffel slung on his shoulder, face drawn from the day.  
- **Collin (mutter):** “Bet… maybe one day AI’ll clean this mess.”  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Nightstand)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin dropping his phone onto the nightstand, faint glow still on the screen. Snickers hops onto the bed behind him, tail curled, ready to settle in.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 3 (Mid, Bed Collapse)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin face-planting into the bed, arms sprawled. His backpack lies discarded nearby.  
- **Collin (thought):** “…Finally.”  

**Panel 4 (Close, Collin & Snickers)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close-up of Collin asleep on his side. Snickers is curled into his chest, Collin’s hand resting gently over him. The mess of the room fades into shadow — soft, warm, human close to end Issue #1.  
- *No dialogue.*
