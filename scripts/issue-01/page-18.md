# Beyond Logic – Issue 1  
## Page 18 (5 Panels, Cinematic Layout)

### Proposed Panel Layout  
- **Panel 1 (Tall Vertical, Left Side):** Collin locking the front door, Snickers at his feet. Silent.  
- **Panel 2 (Wide, Top Right):** Collin dropping into bed, Snickers hopping beside him.  
- **Panel 3 (Small Insert, Overlapping Panel 2):** Snickers circling down, Collin’s hand on him.  
- **Panel 4 (Horizontal Strip, Beneath 2 & 3):** Collin staring at the ceiling, uneasy. Silent.  
- **Panel 5 (Full-Width Anchor at Bottom):** Exterior pull-back of the house tiny under the vast sky, turquoise shimmer above.

### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Tall Vertical, Left Side)**  
- **Art direction:** Vertical panel, narrow and tall. Collin closes and locks the front door, Snickers sitting close by, ears still perked. The interior behind them is dim.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 2 (Wide, Top Right)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide horizontal panel on the top right of the page. Collin drops heavily into bed, blanket pulled loosely across him. Snickers hops up onto the mattress, circling near the foot.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 3 (Small Insert, Overlapping Panel 2)**  
- **Art direction:** Small overlapping insert panel. Snickers curls into place, Collin’s hand resting briefly on his back. A beat of warmth.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 4 (Horizontal Strip, Beneath 2 & 3)**  
- **Art direction:** Thin horizontal panel stretching beneath Panels 2 and 3. Collin lies on his back, eyes open, staring uneasily at the ceiling. His face is tense, exhaustion mixing with unease.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 5 (Full-Width Anchor at Bottom)**  
- **Art direction:** Full-width cinematic pull-back. The house looks small under the vast Texas night sky. Above, faint but unmistakable, a turquoise shimmer lingers — the Watchers watching.  
- *No dialogue.*
