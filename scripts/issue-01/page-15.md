  - **Panel 2 (Mid, Hand/Screen)** → Collin touches glass, faint reflection.  
- **Bottom Row (2 Panels):**  
  - **Panel 3 (Wide, Living Room)** → distorted shimmer hint, Snickers growling toward hallway.  
  - **Panel 4 (Tight, Collin Thought)** → realization lands.

### Script (4 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, Collin & Snickers)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of Collin frozen in front of the now-dark TV, static glow gone. Snickers is beside him, body stiff, hackles raised.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Hand/Screen)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin reaching out, fingertips brushing the dark TV screen. A faint reflection of his own face flickers in the glass.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 3 (Wide, Living Room)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of Collin scanning the dim living room. On the TV’s blank surface, a subtle warped shimmer suggests something unnatural — data distortion or Watcher presence. Snickers crouches low, growling toward the hallway.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 4 (Tight, Collin Thought)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close-up of Collin’s face in shadow, jaw clenched, suspicion sharpening.  
- **Collin (thought):** “That’s… today. Why the hell is it here?”
