1) **Wide:** Ancient Egypt at dawn; pyramids under construction; a distant translucent Watcher ship barely visible.  
2) **Mid:** Engineer‑priest studies a carved tablet; lines glow turquoise across the stone.  
3) **Mid:** Vizier and guards eye the tablet greedily; jewelry catches turquoise.  
4) **Montage:** Ramps, sledges, counterweights; progress accelerates unnaturally; workers strain.
