  - **Panel 1 (Wide, Hallway Establishing)** → full width, Collin walking alone in a crowded AI-saturated hallway.  
- **Middle Row (2 Panels):**  
  - **Panel 2 (Mid, Collin Close Back View)** → left half, focused on Collin’s shoulders and tense posture.  
  - **Panel 3 (Mid, Students Passing)** → right half, groups of students laughing and comparing AI results, oblivious to Collin.  
- **Bottom Row (2 Panels):**  
  - **Panel 4 (Close, Collin Face)** → left half, side profile of Collin, eyes sharp, isolated.  
  - **Panel 5 (Insert, Thought Balloon)** → right half, small inset panel for Collin’s inner thought.

### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, Hallway Establishing)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of a high school hallway crowded with students. Sleek AI posters and glowing screens dominate: *“Efficiency,” “Future of Learning,” “The End of Mistakes.”* Collin walks alone at the center, head down, body language heavy.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Collin Close Back View)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot from behind Collin, showing his shoulders tense as students brush past him. His duffel bag strap cuts across his chest. The silver cross necklace glints faintly at his collar.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 3 (Mid, Students Passing)**  
- **Art direction:** Two students walk past Collin, laughing, showing each other glowing AI predictions on their phones. They’re oblivious to him, caught in their own excitement.  
- **Student (dialogue):** “Bro, AI says I’ll be rich by 30!”  
- **Student 2 (dialogue):** “Lowkey think AI knows me better than I do.”  

**Panel 4 (Close, Collin Face)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight profile shot of Collin’s face, jaw clenched, eyes sharp. The noise of the hallway fades behind him — his expression sells the moment of growing resentment.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 5 (Insert, Thought Balloon)**  
- **Art direction:** Small inset panel with Collin’s eyes framed against a backdrop of AI screens. His inner thought floats above, simple and heavy.  
- **Collin (thought):** “…Great. Even teachers are getting benched. …Hopefully not Mom.”
