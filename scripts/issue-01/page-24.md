# Beyond Logic – Issue 1  
## Page 24 (1-Panel Splash)

### Proposed Layout  
- **Single full-page splash:** The entire page is one vast panel, dominating the close of Issue #1. The Watcher council chamber feels massive, with the Earth projection glowing at its center. A turquoise ripple leaks outward from the projection, faintly tracing Houston on the surface.

### Script (1 Splash Panel with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Full-Page Splash, Council Chamber)**  
- **Art direction:** The splash page captures the sheer scale of the Watcher council chamber. The silhouettes of dozens of Watchers encircle the glowing Earth projection at the center. From the projection, a turquoise ripple pulses outward, its energy veins spreading across the chamber and faintly highlighting Houston.  
- **Watcher Leader (dialogue):** “…The final experiment begins.”  
- **Rebel Watcher (whisper, caption):** “…Maybe this time it won’t fail.”
