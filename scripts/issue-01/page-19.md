# Beyond Logic – Issue 1  
## Page 19 (5 Panels)

### Proposed Panel Layout  
- **Panel 1 (Wide, POV from Above):** From the cloaked ship, Earth below, Collin’s bedroom window faintly rimmed in turquoise. Silent.  
- **Panel 2 (Mid, Ship Corridor):** Sterile corridor of the Watcher ship, turquoise seams glowing faintly. Silent.  
- **Panel 3 (Wide, Council Approach):** Camera entering a vast chamber, Earth projection suspended at the center.  
- **Panel 4 (Close, Leader Silhouette):** Single Watcher form looms — off-panel line: *“…It spreads.”*  
- **Panel 5 (Full Wide, Chamber Scale):** Full scope of the chamber. Watcher silhouettes encircling the projection, rim-lit by turquoise glow. Silent.

### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, POV from Above)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot from high above, POV from the cloaked Watcher ship. The suburban neighborhood is visible far below. Collin’s window glows faintly turquoise against the dark.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Ship Corridor)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot inside the Watcher ship. A long sterile corridor with seamless walls, glowing turquoise veins running like circuitry. Silent, otherworldly.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 3 (Wide, Council Approach)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide panel as the camera enters a vast circular chamber. At its center floats a massive projection of Earth, slowly rotating, rim-lit in turquoise.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 4 (Close, Leader Silhouette)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close-up of a single Watcher silhouette, towering and unreadable, lit only in rim-light turquoise.  
- **Watcher Leader (off-panel):** “…It spreads.”  

**Panel 5 (Full Wide, Chamber Scale)**  
- **Art direction:** Massive wide shot. Dozens of Watcher silhouettes stand around the chamber, Earth’s projection glowing at the center. Their featureless forms are rim-lit, emphasizing their anonymity and power.  
- *No dialogue.*
