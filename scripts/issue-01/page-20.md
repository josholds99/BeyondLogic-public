# Beyond Logic – Issue 1  
## Page 20 (5 Panels)

### Proposed Panel Layout (Z-flow, asymmetrical)
- **Panel 1 (Top strip, full width)** – Narrow horizontal strip across the very top for the **close Earth projection** beat.
- **Panel 2 (Large wide, center-left)** – Dominant panel under Panel 1 (≈60% page width). **Projection expands** here.
- **Panel 3 (Tall vertical, right side)** – Runs alongside Panel 2 from mid-page down. **Close on Watcher Leader** (eyes intensify).
- **Panel 4 (Small insert, over Panel 2 lower-left)** – Overlapping inset for the **hologram flicker**. Silent.
- **Panel 5 (Bottom full-width anchor)** – **Full wide** of the entire council chamber, silent—lands the page.

### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Close, Earth Projection – top strip)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close across the rotating Earth hologram. Turquoise networks pulse like veins over continents.  
- **Watcher Leader (dialogue):** “…Unchecked, it will erase them.”

**Panel 2 (Mid, Projection Expands – large wide center-left)**  
- **Art direction:** The Earth ripple blooms outward, forming a ghostly, symbolic hologram of a “leader” figure—power abstracted rather than literal.  
- **Watcher #2 (dialogue):** “Then we choose a leader… power… authority.”

**Panel 3 (Close, Leader Silhouette – tall vertical right)**  
- **Art direction:** Tall, rim-lit silhouette of the Watcher Leader; eyes intensify with turquoise edge-light, unreadable and cold.  
- **Watcher Leader (dialogue):** “…Weakness cannot be tolerated.”

**Panel 4 (Insert, Hologram Flicker – over Panel 2)**  
- **Art direction:** Small overlapping inset: the hologram jitters, glitches, and warps erratically; edges tear like data.  
- *No dialogue.*

**Panel 5 (Full Wide, Council Silent – bottom anchor)**  
- **Art direction:** Massive pull to show chamber scale: concentric ranks of Watcher silhouettes encircle the unstable projection; all rim-lit in turquoise, utterly silent.  
- *No dialogue.*
