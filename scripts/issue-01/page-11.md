### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, Kitchen)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of Josh in the kitchen shaking a protein drink. Collin enters in the background, duffel slung over his shoulder. Warm kitchen lighting contrasts with the weight of Josh’s words.  
- **Josh (dialogue):** “They’re rolling out AI monitors at the office. Supposed to make us more efficient.”  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Collin)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin leaning on the counter, frowning slightly, expression skeptical. His posture is tired, eyes sharp.  
- **Collin (thought):** “…Yeah, sounds thrilling.”  

**Panel 3 (Mid, Living Room)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin at the couch. Snickers is curled up asleep. Collin carefully pulls his backpack off the cushion next to the dog, watching him fondly for a moment.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 4 (Mid, Hallway)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot down the hallway as Collin walks past Everett’s door. Everett is asleep, sprawled with his neon socks visible, tablet glowing faintly. Collin pauses briefly, expression softening.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 5 (Mid, Bedroom Door)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin reaching his own bedroom door at the end of the hallway. His body language is tired but steady, retreating to be alone with his thoughts.  
- *No dialogue.*
