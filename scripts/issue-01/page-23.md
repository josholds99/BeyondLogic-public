### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Close, Rebel Hand – Top Row Left)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close-up of the Rebel’s hand. Turquoise sparks dance across the knuckles and fingertips, unstable but controlled.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 2 (Wide, Earth Projection – Top Row Right)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of the Earth hologram. Collin’s suburban neighborhood glows faintly turquoise, like a pinpoint flaring within the whole projection.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 3 (Mid, Council Leader – Middle Row)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of the Watcher Leader, cloaked silhouette lit from below by turquoise glow. Voice heavy and inevitable.  
- **Watcher Leader (dialogue):** “…The experiment begins.”  

**Panel 4 (Close, Rebel Whisper – Bottom Row)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close-up of the Rebel Watcher, face bowed slightly, lit faintly in turquoise. Whisper delivered almost to himself.  
- **Caption (Rebel, whisper):** “…Better an accident…”  

**Panel 5 (Insert, Rebel Profile – Overlapping Panel 4)**  
- **Art direction:** Small inset overlapping Panel 4. Profile view of the Rebel’s hooded face, shadow deep, eyes glinting faint turquoise.  
- **Caption (cont., Rebel whisper):** “…than another failure.”
