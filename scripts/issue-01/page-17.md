# Beyond Logic – Issue 1  
## Page 17 (5 Panels, Revised Layout)

### Proposed Panel Layout  
- **Top Row (1 Panel):**  
  - **Panel 1 (Wide, Yard)** → Snickers halts mid-step on the front lawn, staring up. Silent.  
- **Middle Row (2 Panels):**  
  - **Panel 2 (Close, Collin)** → frown, following Snickers’ gaze.  
  - **Panel 3 (Wide, Neighborhood)** → quiet street, faint turquoise shimmer outlining a cloaked ship above.  
- **Bottom Row (2 Panels):**  
  - **Panel 4 (Insert, Collin Face)** → lit by sky glow, doubt creeping. Silent.  
  - **Panel 5 (Mid, Retreat)** → Collin nudges Snickers back inside, convincing himself it’s nothing.

### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, Yard)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of Snickers frozen mid-step on the lawn, head tilted up at the night sky, ears pricked. The house glows faintly behind them.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 2 (Close, Collin)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close-up of Collin’s face, eyes narrowing as he follows Snickers’ gaze upward.  
- **Collin (thought):** “…What now…”  

**Panel 3 (Wide, Neighborhood)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of the quiet suburban street under the night sky. Above, faint and massive, a turquoise shimmer outlines the form of a cloaked ship. It’s barely visible, more suggested than shown.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 4 (Insert, Collin Face)**  
- **Art direction:** Small inset panel. Collin’s face lit faintly by turquoise light, unease and doubt written across it.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 5 (Mid, Retreat)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin nudging Snickers gently with his foot toward the open doorway. Snickers hesitates before padding inside. Collin lingers, glancing upward one last time.  
- **Collin (thought):** “…Just clouds. I’m seeing things.”
