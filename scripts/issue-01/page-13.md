- **Middle Row (2 Panels):**  
  - **Panel 3 (Mid, Sit Up)** → Collin sits up, mutters to himself.  
  - **Panel 4 (Insert, Snickers)** → low growl at the bedroom door. Silent.

  - **Panel 5 (Wide, Hallway)** → Collin barefoot, cautious step out into the dark hallway.  
  - **Panel 6 (Close, Thought Balloon)** → tight close on Collin’s face with inner thought.
