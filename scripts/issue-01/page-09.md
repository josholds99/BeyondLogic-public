### Script (6 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Mid, Cafeteria Wide)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium-wide shot of students at crowded cafeteria tables, laughing, eating, and holding up phones/tablets. AI-branded apps glow brightly. The energy feels chaotic.  
- **Student (dialogue):** “Mine says I’ve got varsity locked!”  
- **Student 2 (dialogue):** “Bet I’m going pro in five years!”  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Students with Tablet)**  
- **Art direction:** Close-up on two students leaning over a glowing tablet. The screen shows a flashy “AI Career Predictor” app with graphs and bold text.  
- **Student (dialogue):** “Bro, AI never misses. Teachers stay taking Ls.”  

**Panel 3 (Mid, Mocking Collin)**  
- **Art direction:** Two classmates at a nearby table look at Collin with smirks. One cups his hands like shouting, the other laughs into his tray.  
- **Classmate (dialogue):** “Yo, Young — AI already drafted you… to bench warmer.”  

**Panel 4 (Mid, Collin Close)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close-up on Collin’s hand clenching into a fist on the table, his tray pushed aside. His face in profile, jaw set, eyes sharp. His cross necklace glints faintly under the harsh cafeteria lights.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 5 (Wide, Hallway Exit)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot from behind Collin as he walks down the cafeteria exit hallway. The laughter and noise trail behind him, shown with faint dialogue balloons fading.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 6 (Insert, Reflection)**  
- **Art direction:** Narrow vertical panel showing the cafeteria hallway window. Reflected faintly is the shimmer of a Watcher ship, distorted but noticeable. The hallway itself looks empty around Collin.  
- *No dialogue.*
