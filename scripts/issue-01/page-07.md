# Beyond Logic – Issue 1  
## Page 8 (5 Panels)

### Proposed Panel Layout  
- **Top Row:**  
  - **Panel 1 (Wide, Classroom)** → full width across the top, establishing shot of the room and AI grading intro.  
- **Middle Row:**  
  - **Panel 2 (Mid, Teacher)** → left third, teacher uneasy.  
  - **Panel 3 (Mid, Classmates Teasing)** → center third, classmates mocking.  
  - **Panel 4 (Mid, Collin)** → right third, Collin silent, resentment building.  
- **Bottom Row:**  
  - **Panel 5 (Wide, Hallway)** → full width, Collin isolated as AI announcements fill the background.  

This layout keeps dialogue clustered in the middle row, while Panels 1 and 5 serve as wide bookends to frame the page and give breathing room.

### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, Classroom)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of a high school classroom. The teacher stands at the front with a nervous posture as a projection screen displays “AI Grading Pilot Program” in clean, glowing letters. Students sit in desks with tablets or screens in front of them, some excited, some distracted.  
- **Teacher (dialogue):** “Starting today, assignments will be graded by the new AI system.”  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Teacher)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot on the teacher, sweat beading slightly at the temple, eyes uneasy. Their body language conveys discomfort, hinting they don’t fully trust what they’re saying.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 3 (Mid, Classmates Teasing)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of two classmates leaning toward each other, smirking. One whispers loudly enough to be heard, the other laughs.  
- **Classmate (dialogue):** “AI’ll replace coaches too!”  

**Panel 4 (Mid, Collin)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin sitting at his desk. His jaw is tight, hands clenched slightly around his pencil. His silver cross necklace glints faintly as the projector glow hits it.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 5 (Wide, Hallway)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of Collin walking down a hallway lined with glowing AI screens and posters: “Efficiency,” “Accuracy,” “Future of Learning.” Students pass by in groups, but Collin is framed alone in the center, isolated against the overwhelming digital noise.  
- *No dialogue.*
