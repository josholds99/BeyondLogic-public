# Beyond Logic – Issue 1  
## Page 7 (5 Panels)

### Proposed Panel Layout  
- **Top Row:**  
  - **Panel 1 (Wide)** → full width across the top (establishing the living room and TV broadcast).  
- **Middle Row:**  
  - **Panel 2 (Mid, Josh)** → left half.  
  - **Panel 3 (Mid, Collin)** → right half.  
- **Bottom Row:**  
  - **Panel 4 (Insert, TV Reflection)** → narrow vertical inset on the left, sized small to emphasize detail.  
  - **Panel 5 (Close, Collin)** → larger close-up on the right, dominating the bottom row.  

This layout gives:  
- Strong opening beat across the whole family (Panel 1).  
- Balanced split between Josh and Collin (Panels 2 & 3).  
- A tension build with the reflection insert (Panel 4) leading into Collin’s reaction close (Panel 5).  
- Balloon flow: TV dialogue up top → Josh’s line mid-left → Collin silent mid-right → reflection insert silent → close Collin silent. Easy to letter with breathing space.

### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, Living Room – TV Broadcast)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of the Young family in the living room. The oversized sectional is in place, TV on the west wall glowing in the darkened room. Bailey and Everett are relaxed, Josh seated forward, Collin angled slightly apart. The TV screen shows a news anchor at a sleek desk with AI-themed graphics behind them. Soft evening lighting mixes with the TV glow.  
- **TV Anchor (dialogue):** “…the latest AI update shows performance improvements of 42%, raising questions about whether human intervention slows progress.”  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Josh)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot on Josh, arms crossed, leaning slightly forward. His expression is skeptical but calm, eyes narrowing. The blue glow from the TV catches in his gray-streaked hair and beard.  
- **Josh (dialogue):** “Forty-two percent sounds great in a press release. Still won’t fix lazy people.”  

**Panel 3 (Mid, Collin)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin sitting on the sectional, posture a bit rigid. He glances at Josh, expression subdued but uneasy. His silver cross necklace catches the TV glow faintly.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 4 (Insert, TV Reflection)**  
- **Art direction:** Close insert on the TV glass. Alongside the anchor’s image, a faint shimmer of a Watcher ship is reflected — almost imperceptible, blending into the glow.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 5 (Close, Collin)**  
- **Art direction:** Close-up on Collin’s face, eyes fixed on the TV. A subtle unease sits beneath the calm — the weight of what he saw beginning to land. Shadows emphasize his distance from the others.  
- *No dialogue.*
