# Beyond Logic – Issue 1  
## Page 22 (5 Panels)

### Proposed Panel Layout (Applied to Page Flow)

- **Top Row (1 Wide Panel):**  
  - **Panel 1 (Wide, Leader Command):** Stretches across the top of the page. The Watcher Leader dominates, hand raised, turquoise energy beginning to build. This opener feels commanding and sets the chamber scale.  

- **Second Row (2 Panels, Asymmetrical):**  
  - **Panel 2 (Mid, Rebel):** Left half. Cloaked face shadowed, eyes glow. Caption: *“…Not this time.”*  
  - **Panel 3 (Insert, Rebel Hand):** A small vertical inset overlapping the right edge of Panel 2, showing the Rebel’s hand subtly crackling. Silent.  

- **Third Row (1 Mid Panel, Large):**  
  - **Panel 4 (Mid, Distortion):** Dominant mid-page panel on the right side, contrasting Panel 2. The Earth hologram ripples unnaturally, warping as sabotage begins.  

- **Bottom Row (1 Wide Panel):**  
  - **Panel 5 (Wide, Council Chamber):** Full-width anchor panel at the bottom. All the other Watchers are focused on the Leader, rim-lit and silent, blind to the Rebel’s interference.

### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, Leader Command – Top Row)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of the Watcher Leader raising one massive, cloaked hand. Turquoise energy builds across the chamber like veins in the air.  
- **Watcher Leader (dialogue):** “…Prepare the empowerment. A leader will be chosen.”  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Rebel – Second Row Left)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of the Rebel Watcher, partially shadowed. Their cloaked face is unreadable, but faint turquoise light glows from their eyes.  
- **Caption (Rebel, thought):** “…Not this time.”  

**Panel 3 (Insert, Rebel Hand – Second Row Overlapping Right)**  
- **Art direction:** Small vertical inset overlapping Panel 2. Close-up of the Rebel’s hand, fingers slightly curled, arcs of turquoise crackle faintly toward the projection stream.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 4 (Mid, Distortion – Third Row Large)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of the Earth hologram at the chamber’s center. The projection ripples unnaturally, warping like disturbed water, faint distortions spreading through it.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 5 (Wide, Council Chamber – Bottom Row)**  
- **Art direction:** Full-width bottom panel. Dozens of Watcher silhouettes stand still, rim-lit, focused entirely on the Leader. None notice the distortion or the Rebel’s interference.  
- *No dialogue.*
