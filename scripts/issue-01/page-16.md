### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Mid, Living Room)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin in the dim living room, TV black behind him. Snickers barks at the darkness, fur bristling. Collin gestures toward him, trying to calm him down.  
- **Collin (dialogue):** ‚ÄúChill, Snick. It‚Äôs done.‚Äù  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Snickers at Door)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Snickers bolting toward the front door, claws skittering on the floor. Collin watches with unease.  
- **Collin (thought):** ‚Äú‚Ä¶You too, huh?‚Äù  

**Panel 3 (Wide, Doorway)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of Collin opening the front door. Cool night air spills in, carrying faint city sounds. Snickers darts outside into the dark. Collin squints into the night.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 4 (Mid, Porch Close)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin barefoot on the porch, arms crossed against the chill. His expression is tense, scanning the quiet street.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 5 (Wide, Pull-Back)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide pull-back shot. Collin looks small standing on the porch. Beyond him, the faint outline of the Houston skyline glows against the night sky. Above it, barely visible, a subtle shimmer hints at something watching.  
- *No dialogue.*
