### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, Living Room Entry)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of Collin stepping into the dark living room. The TV glows with harsh static, lighting the space in cold tones. Snickers edges in behind him.  
- **Collin (thought):** “Bruh, why’s he up? Watch me catch the blame.”  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Collin)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin narrowing his eyes, approaching the TV cautiously. His body language is irritated more than afraid.  
- **Collin (dialogue):** “Seriously?”  

**Panel 3 (Close, TV Screen)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close-up of the TV. The static sharpens into an image of Everett asleep in bed, projected eerily real.  
- **SFX:** *bzzzt… click.*  

**Panel 4 (Tight, Collin)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close-up of Collin’s face, lit by the TV glow. His eyes widen slightly, shock breaking through annoyance.  
- **Collin (dialogue):** “…WTF?”  

**Panel 5 (Wide, Living Room)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of the living room from behind Collin. The TV POPS black, leaving the room suddenly darker. Snickers in the foreground, hackles raised, growls low.  
- **SFX:** *POP!*  
- *No dialogue.*
