### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, Living Room Entry)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of Collin stepping into the living room. The TV glows with harsh static, lighting the space in cold tones. Snickers edges in behind him, ears perked.  
- **Collin (thought):** “Bruh, why’s it even on? Watch me catch the blame.”  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Collin)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Collin narrowing his eyes, approaching the TV cautiously. His body language is irritated more than afraid.  
- **Collin (dialogue):** “Seriously?”  

**Panel 3 (Close, TV Screen)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close-up of the TV. The static sharpens into **cafeteria footage from earlier today** — kids laughing, holding glowing phones. It’s unmistakably *his school, his day*.  
- **SFX:** *bzzzt… click.*  

**Panel 4 (Tight, Collin)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close-up of Collin’s face, shock breaking through his annoyance. Eyes wide, TV glow reflected in his pupils.  
- **Collin (dialogue):** “…What the…?”  

**Panel 5 (Wide, Living Room)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of the living room from behind Collin. The TV POPS black, leaving the room suddenly darker. Snickers in the foreground, hackles raised, growls low toward the screen.  
- **SFX:** *POP!*  
- *No dialogue.*
