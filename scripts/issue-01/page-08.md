### Proposed Panel Layout  
- **Top Row (2 Panels):**  
  - **Panel 1 (Mid, Teacher)** → left half, introducing AI grading.  
  - **Panel 2 (Mid, Classmates Teasing)** → right half, mocking Collin.  
- **Middle Row (Wide):**  
  - **Panel 3 (Wide, Classroom)** → full width, Collin silent, AI projection dominating the space.  
- **Bottom Row (2 Panels):**  
  - **Panel 4 (Mid, Teacher Close)** → left third, teacher’s frustration emphasized.  
  - **Panel 5 (Wide, Hallway)** → right two-thirds, Collin isolated in an AI-saturated hallway.

### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Mid, Teacher)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of teacher at front of the classroom. Projected text behind them reads *“AI Grading Pilot Program.”* The teacher looks composed but carries an edge of discomfort.  
- **Teacher (dialogue):** “Starting today, assignments will be graded by the new AI system.”  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Classmates Teasing)**  
- **Art direction:** Two classmates in the foreground lean toward each other, smirking. Their laughter feels loud enough to carry across the room.  
- **Classmate (dialogue):** “Bet AI’ll replace coaches too!”  

**Panel 3 (Wide, Classroom)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of the classroom under the glow of the projector. Students laugh or whisper. Collin sits rigid, angled slightly away, fist tight around his pencil. His silver cross necklace glints faintly. The teacher stands awkwardly at the front, overshadowed by the AI projection glow.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 4 (Mid, Teacher Close)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight close-up on the teacher’s face. Brow furrowed, jaw clenched — anger mixed with humiliation. Their posture feels small against the harsh glow of the projection.  
- **Teacher (dialogue):** “AI overruled my grade.”  

**Panel 5 (Wide, Hallway)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of Collin in the school hallway. AI posters dominate: *“Efficiency,” “Accuracy,” “Future of Learning.”* Students pass in groups, laughing and comparing apps. Collin walks alone in the center, framed by the glowing digital saturation.  
- *No dialogue.*
