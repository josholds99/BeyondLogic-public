# Beyond Logic – Issue 1  
## Page 21 (5 Panels)

### Proposed Panel Layout (Page Flow)  
- **Top Row (1 Panel, Wide):**  
  - **Panel 1 (Wide, Rebel Group):** A small cluster of Watchers apart from the rest of the chamber. This opener establishes them visually as outsiders.  

- **Second Row (2 Panels):**  
  - **Panel 2 (Mid, Rebel):** Medium shot of one Rebel Watcher, eyes glowing faint turquoise.  
  - **Panel 3 (Insert, Hands):** Small vertical inset to the right, showing fists clenching with faint turquoise arcs.  

- **Third Row (1 Panel, Close):**  
  - **Panel 4 (Close, Profile):** Rebel Watcher’s profile as he turns away from the council. Dialogue trails here.  

- **Bottom Row (1 Panel, Wide):**  
  - **Panel 5 (Wide, Walk Off):** The Rebel Watcher receding into shadow at the bottom of the page, the council looming far behind. A caption whispers the final line.

### Script (5 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, Rebel Group – Top Row)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot inside the council chamber. A small group of Watchers stand apart from the larger circle, slightly rim-lit. Their presence feels defiant.  
- **Rebel Watcher (dialogue):** “…Every empire you empowered fell. Authority rots. Logic fails.”  

**Panel 2 (Mid, Rebel – Second Row Left)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of a single Rebel Watcher. His eyes glow faint turquoise, cutting sharper against the dark.  
- **Rebel Watcher (dialogue):** “…Logic alone cannot save them.”  

**Panel 3 (Insert, Hands – Second Row Right)**  
- **Art direction:** Small vertical inset. The Rebel’s fists clench tight, faint arcs of turquoise energy crackling around them.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 4 (Close, Profile – Third Row)**  
- **Art direction:** Tight profile of the Rebel turning away from the chamber floor, posture rigid but voice steady.  
- **Rebel Watcher (dialogue):** “…If you empower a leader…”  

**Panel 5 (Wide, Walk Off – Bottom Row)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of the Rebel Watcher walking into shadow, back to the chamber. The larger circle of Watchers looms in the distance, silent.  
- **Caption (whisper):** “…you doom them again.”
