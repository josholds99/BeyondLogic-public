## Page 6 (6 Panels with Art Direction)

**Panel 1 (Wide, Dining Table)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot of the Young family at dinner. Warm overhead farmhouse pendant light. Wooden dining table with simple plates and food. Bailey is setting down a bowl, Everett already eating, Josh sits steady with arms relaxed, Collin sits slightly apart, body leaning away from the table. The atmosphere is warm but Collin feels visually disconnected.  
- *No dialogue.*

**Panel 2 (Mid, Bailey & Collin)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot focusing on Bailey and Collin across from each other. Bailey leans in with a gentle, warm smile, eyes soft. Collin slouches, eyes lowered, fiddling with his fork. Background glows warmly from the pendant light, isolating the moment.  
- **Bailey:** “You barely touched your plate. Long day?”  
- **Collin:** (shrugs) “Something like that.”  

**Panel 3 (Close, Everett)**  
- **Art direction:** Close-up on Everett grinning mischievously, lifting one foot to show off his neon dinosaur socks under the table. His eyes sparkle with humor, cheeky grin wide. The background is blurred to highlight the socks and his playful personality.  
- **Everett:** “Maybe he’s jealous of my sock game. Dinosaurs make everything better.”  

**Panel 4 (Mid, Collin & Josh)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot. Collin pokes at his food with a faint smirk, eyes still distant. Across from him, Josh watches closely — beard, eyes narrowed just slightly, carrying weight. Composition emphasizes the quiet tension between them. Bailey and Everett slightly blurred in background, laughing together.  
- *No dialogue.*  

**Panel 5 (Mid, Bailey & Everett)**  
- **Art direction:** Medium shot of Bailey ruffling Everett’s hair as he laughs with his mouth half-full. Bailey’s expression is amused, her hand affectionate. Everett hams it up, showing his socks again like a proud comedian. Warm tones dominate, playful mood.  
- **Bailey:** “Don’t encourage him.”  
- **Everett:** “Too late.”  

**Panel 6 (Wide, Family Together)**  
- **Art direction:** Wide shot, framing the entire table. Bailey and Everett glowing with warmth on the right, Josh solid and watchful on the left, Collin in the middle but visually separated (slight shadows, posture closed off). The composition emphasizes the “together but apart” theme — Collin is physically there but emotionally elsewhere.  
- *No dialogue.*
